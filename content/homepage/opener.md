My name is Mrs. Moulin. I live in Long Beach with my husband and two boys. Born in California and raised with French and Mexican heritages. I have always found myself very comfortable in the kitchen, and enjoyed a meal with a proper place setting. I started my career as a pantry cook, and soon became a Sous Chef for The Food Matters Catering Co. I currently teach cooking classes, etiqutte class and make custom order bake goods, charcuterie boards and more. Food is my passion, a source of life, and brings people together. The best part is, I get to share it with people!


Etiqutte Class Goals
This class offers boys and girls an opportunity to learn proper table etiquette and simple courtesies while dining anywhere.


Cooking Class Goals
 This class is designed for the younger generation to feel comfortable and confident in a kitchen. Exploring cooking techniques, expand palates, introduce knife skills and food saftey.

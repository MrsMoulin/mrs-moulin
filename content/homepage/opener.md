My name is Mrs. Moulin. I live in Long Beach with my husband and two boys. Born in California and raised with French and Mexican heritages. I have always found myself very comfortable in the kitchen, and enjoyed a meal with a proper place setting. I graduated from Le Cordon Bleu, Pasadena and started my career as a pantry cook, and soon became a Sous Chef for The Food Matters Catering Co. I currently teach cooking classes, etiquette class and make custom bake goods, charcuterie boards and more. Food is my passion, a source of life, and brings people together. The best part is, I get to share it with people!

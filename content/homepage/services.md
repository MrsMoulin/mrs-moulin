## Cooking Class

My hands on cooking classes are personally curated to the individual. Each class teaches proper food handling, knife skills, and proper cooking techniques. Most classes are 3-course meal driven, which includes an appetizer, main dish and dessert in a three hour class. Ages 10+ | Starts at $75+
